Pomodoros only count is you complete the ENTIRE 25 minutes
After a pomodoro, you get a 5 minutes break
After 4 pomodoros, you get a 30 minute break

Locked into the timer until task is done. Timer for break then
starts. You have an option to STOP

Finite state machine:

READY -> Start -> STARTED -> 25 minutes finish -> FINISHED
                          -> Leave page/stop timer -> READY

Passwords are stored as plaintext right now. Couldn't figure out
django.contrib.auth.models.User and how it hashes its passwords.
Definitely needs to be done in a real app
