- Task and Timer view could be improved
- Pomodoros only count is you complete the ENTIRE 25 minutes. If you leave the page before
  the 25 minutes is up, the "pomodoros" fild will not be incremented
- Passwords and users are done using django.contrib.auth


- Decided on Django for two reasons:
    1. I'm very familiar with Python
    2. pymetrics uses Django so I figured I should learn
